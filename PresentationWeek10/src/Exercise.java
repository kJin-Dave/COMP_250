    /*Presentation exercise 5
Suppose that you are given an array of n different numbers that strictly increase from index 0 to index
m, and strictly decrease from index m to index n âˆ’ 1, where n is known but m is unknown. Note that
there is a unique largest number in such a list, and it is at index m. Write a recursive method that
returns the index m of the largest number in the array, in time proportional to log n. Your method
should not use any additional data structure.
